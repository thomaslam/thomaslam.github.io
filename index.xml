      <description>Notes  Alpha Go vs Ke Jie in 2017 was China&amp;rsquo;s Sputnik moment inspiring Chinese gov. + startup entrepreneurs + VC investors to put huge effort into ramping up Chinese AI ecosystem (R&amp;amp;D + commercial + military)
 Feb 2019 article to understand Chinese AI strategy  Chinese startup world is extremely cut-throat, contrasts sharply with more &amp;ldquo;tame&amp;rdquo; SV ecosystem
 Copying other startups&amp;rsquo; unique features is acceptable Work life balance is non-existent Startups must find ways to differentiate themselves from others even if it means under-handed tactics are used  China vs US in battle for global AI dominance in coming decades: each has their own adv/disadv.</description>

No ML/DS section for this week
News  Amazon:
 Video on how Amazon makes one-day shipping the new norm  Amazon is increasingly relying on its own logistics network as opposed to UPS or US Postal Service to deliver packages either long-range (Amazon Air) or last-mile (Amazon Flex) Combination of robots and workers in fulfillment centers Tech innovation for delivery: drones, robots, etc.  Amazon Prime Day strike: indicative of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s ongoing issue with dangerous working conditions and impossible standards for warehouse workers.</description>

      <description>This page lists books I have read (recently in 2019), related notes as well as books I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. Books I have started but I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a chance to
TODO: consolidate this page into a web app similar to highlights.sawyerh.com with following functionalities: visually track progress, summary stats (what genres read, ratings, notes, highlights)
Books I&amp;rsquo;m (actively) reading  Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy - Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neal (8%) Educated: A Memoir - Tara Westover (4%) Modern Romance - Aziz Ansari (16%)</description>

Missed a few weeks oops ðŸ˜¬
News  Melinda Gates&amp;rsquo; new book on women empowerment as means to lift up society
 Added to reading list  Waymo completes 10 billion virtual miles in simulation [link]
 Why important: more training data =&amp;gt; better tech   Big ideas  Don&amp;rsquo;t try to be an influencer. Try to be a nerd instead
 Being a nerd pays off Being an influencer is a bad metric for self-worth; some people will never capture another people&amp;rsquo;s needs or attention; being a nerd is always a winning strategy  Difference between workaholics and high performers</description>

Update 7-22-19:  Finished Sequence Models course
 Coursera&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning (Andrew Ng) Coursera&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialication (Andrew Ng):  Neural Networks and Deep Learning Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization (IN PROGRESS) Structuring Machine Learning Projects (IN PROGRESS) Convolutional Neural Networks (IN PROGRESS) Sequence Models  Coursera&amp;rsquo;s Tensorflow in Practice Specialization fast.</description>

      <title>Deriving cross-entropy loss gradient</title>

      <description>Note: This post assumes familiarity of vector notations and strong knowledge of (partial) derivatives which is covered in a Multivariable Calculus class.
In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how to derive the gradient (vector of partial derivatives) of the cost function for logistic regression (also known as cross entropy loss). This is an important part of backpropagation step/gradient descent algorithm in training logistic regression model (which I have explained in an earlier blog post) as in order to update the model parameters, we need to know the gradient of the cost function with respect to them.</description>

      <title>Logistic regression explained</title>

      <description>Logistic regression is one of the most famous ML models used in supervised learning settings. Despite the term &amp;ldquo;regression&amp;rdquo; in its name, this model is mostly used for classification tasks. An important distinction between logistic regression and another very popular supervised learning model, linear regression, is that the response variable is categorical for the former but continuous for the latter.
Most ML researchers use this model as a baseline in many supervised learning tasks because of its simplicity.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning: an overview</title>
      <link>https://thomaslam.github.io/post/machine-learning-an-overview/</link>

      <description>In this introductory post, I introduce what Machine Learning is in hopefully a widely accessible language. I aim to minimize as many buzzwords as possible though certain terminologies such as matrices, vectors, statistical models, parameters, etc. will come up. A basic understanding of what these terms mean is assumed.
What is Machine Learning? According to computer scientist Arthur Samuel in 1959, Machine Learning is a subfield of Computer Science that gives â€œcomputers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.</description>

      <description>Week 04/15 - 04/21
This is the first post of my weekly blog series on interesting things I&amp;rsquo;ve read/listened. I also try to keep myself accountable in terms of self education by including the What I am working on section at the end.
News  Notre Dame fire
 Sri Lanka Easter bombings
 Mueller report
 TLDR: found no conclusive evidence of Trump admin&amp;rsquo;s collusion with Russia; showed instances of Trump clearly frustrated about the investigation and tried to manipulate the justice system in many ways  Verge&amp;rsquo;s coverage of Andrew Yang</description>

      <description>Keeping a consistent blogging schedule has always been a challenge for me. Hopefully this time, I manage to get a few blog posts in before eventually life (and my procrastination tendency) kicks in. The purpose of this blog is to consolidate my thoughts on what I have learned on my journey in becoming a better software engineer/Machine Learning practitioner.
So yes most of my content is technical in nature. However, I do plan to write blog posts that are more mundane (book reviews, weekly digests of interesting reads and general reflections on life lessons).</description>

      <description>My name is Thomas Lam. I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer working at Capital One based in McClean, VA.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in all things data science or machine learning related (and developing software in general). This website is meant to capture my journey on being a bit more knowledgeable about this vast and fascinating field.
Occasionally here you&amp;rsquo;ll find my collections/ramblings on books/articles/media I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed and other general non-technical stuff.
