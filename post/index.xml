      <description>Keeping a consistent blogging schedule has always been a challenge for me. Hopefully this time, I manage to get a few blog posts in before eventually life (and my procrastination tendency) kicks in. The purpose of this blog is to consolidate my thoughts on what I have learned on my journey in becoming a better software engineer/Machine Learning practitioner.
So yes most of my content is technical in nature. However, I do plan to write blog posts that are more mundane (book reviews, weekly digests of interesting reads and general reflections on life lessons)</description>
